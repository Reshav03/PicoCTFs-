Fat32 Filesystem 

And how to extract human-readable from that particular disk image  

In this challenge we have been given a disk image in the challenge

Lets download this disk in the tmp directory in the webshell

href=image (1).png

After download do the Gunzip to extract the disk image

Lets see the type of the file this is 

Use the File command to check the file type

The `file` command in Linux is used to **determine the type of a file** based on its **content**, not its extension.

### ðŸ“˜ **Basic Syntax**

```bash

file filename
```

We see that this image is a FAT32 filesystem

### ðŸ“‚ What is a FAT32 Filesystem?

**FAT32** stands for **File Allocation Table 32-bit**. It is a **legacy file system** created by Microsoft, widely used for removable drives and older operating systems.

Now we need to extract strings from the FAT32 Filesystem 

Extracting strings from a FAT32 filesystem typically means retrieving **human-readable text** from **binary files**, **disk images**, or **partitions**. This is often done in **digital forensics**, **malware analysis**, or **data recovery**.

Lets now extract

String command -

This command **extracts and views all human-readable text strings** from a **disk image file** called `disko-1.dd` using `strings`, and then pipes it through `less` for **paged viewing**.

Now lets search for the flag

And Ta-da we found it
